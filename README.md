# PasswordManager
Welcome! Do you know the feeling when you really want to log in to your account but you forgot the password?
## One solution to all your problem
PasswordManager helps you remember you passwords, you just have to set-up a universal password (We recommend you to use a really strong password, at least all your password will be in secure hands) and use it to access all the entries (entries is the name we decided to use for the password you saved in the program).
### Download
There are 2 ways to download this app.

### Usage
In future update we're gonna add more specific instructions to the in-app `/help` command, for now carefully read this:
***At the first start***
Nothing's gonna work if you hadn't set a universal password, this password has to be pretty strong because it's the password that make you access all the entries you saved.
Use the `/setUniversalPassword` command to set a universal password, make sure nobody knows it.
***Normal usage***
Here is a list of all commands:
> `/help` this command simply print a list of all the commands now active.\
> `/exit` running this command will close the application\
> `/entryAdd` this command allows you to create new entries to save password\
> `/entryDelete` this command do exactly the opposite of `/entryAdd`: delete a entry\
> `/entry` this is the most important command, running it will make you see the chosen entry and the associeted password\
> `/reset` resets all the data registered, careful with this command\
> `/setUniversalPassword` this command will work only if you hadn't already set a universal password, you'll simply be able to set a universal password\
